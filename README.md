Currently in the design stage of a Raspberry Pi-based project to draw together the disciplines of Computer Science, Science, Geography, Mathematics and Design Technology.
The main idea of stage 1 is to create a network of weather stations built by students and managed by students in the 75 Cognita Schools around the world. Specifying the weather station model helps us to standardize equipment and data. We are considering the https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/weather-station model. 
WE ARE NOT INTENDING TO RE-INVENT THE WHEEL :-)
These weather stations will be collecting environmental data which will be interrogated locally and also be sent to a central database for all of the schools to use.
The first phase is to send out a request to interested parties and with that a pack describing the basic weather station model which we will all start with.
It is invisaged that data should be limited to temperature, and rainfall in the first instance. Though oviously schools can develop other data streams as well.
The date for weather stations to come on-line is during second week in January 2022.
Schools will be invited to develop modules to intergrate into our project.
